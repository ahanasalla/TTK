*   Add delay for picking up the item for a specific branch, Example, a client who sells prepared meals that his customers pick up each week. But they must order by wednesday at midnight if they want to pick up on monday, otherwise monday will not be available , so you add the delay for the order in hours and the user get notified in the checkout page that there is a delay in this branch for some hours, and when the store owner get email with the right time to prepare the shipment. ( please check the demo )
