This extension plugin allows you to schedule product purchase availability in your WooCommerce store.
Tested with WooCommerce version 2.5.2

== Description ==

The WooCommerce Scheduler provides store owners an option to set a purchase availability time for products in the store. By entering the start date and end date for a product, you can sell the product in your WooCommerce store, for a particular time duration. Once the time expires, the product will still be available in the store, but you will not be able to purchase it.
